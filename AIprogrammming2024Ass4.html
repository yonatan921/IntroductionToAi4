<H2> Programming assignment - Decision-making under uncertainty  </H2>
<H2>MAPD Problem</H2>
        </CENTER>
<p>

<H3>Goals </H3>
<P>
Sequential decision making under uncertainty using 
belief-state MDP for decision-making in the MAPD.
(This is an obscure variant of the Canadian traveler problem.)

<H3>MAPD Delivery Decision Problem - Domain Description</H3>

<P>
The domain description is similar to that described in assignment 1,
except that again  we do not know the locations of the blocakges.
For simplicity, however, we will assume that the blockages occur independently, (i.e. that all fragile edges that
will be blocked are
already been blocked, but we don't know for certain whether they are) with a known
given probability. They are revealed with certainty when the agent reaches 
an adjacent vertex.

<P>
Thus, in the current problem to be solved, we are given a grid-based
undirected graph, where each edge has a known probability of being blocked.
These distributions are jointly independent.
The agent's only actions are traveling between vertices.
Also for simplicity, we will assume only one agent, starting at s already holding a package, and only one known
delivery location, and that the true state of a fragile edge never changes (that is, if initially blocked
it stays blocked, and if initially unblocked it stays unblocked, even if the agent traverses it).
The problem is to find a policy that delivers the package in as short a time as possible (in expectation).

<P>
The graph can be provided in a manner similar to previous assignments, for example:


<pre>
#X 4                ; Maximum x coordinate
#Y 3                ; Maximum y coordinate
#P 0 0 0  D 4 3 50  ; Package at (0,3) from time 5, deliver to (4,0) on or before time 50
#B 3 0 4 0          ; Edge from (3,0) to (4,0) is always blocked
#B 2 2 2 3          ; Edge from (2,2) to (2,3) is always blocked
#F 0 1 0 2 0.4      ; Edge from (0,1) to (0,2) is fragile, blocked with probability 0.4 
#A 0 0              ; Normal agent starts at (0,0)
</pre>


<P>
The start and goal (target) vertices, should be determined via some
form of user input (as in the file, or querying the user). For example,
in the above graph the start vertex is (0,0), and the goal (target) vertex is (4,3).

<H3>Solution method</H3>

<P>
The Canadian traveller problem is known to be PSPACE-complete (and it is likely that the
uncertain MAPD problem is also PSPACE-complete) so you will
be required to solve only very small instances. We will require that the
entire belief space be stored in memory explicitly, and thus impose a limit
of grid size at most 6 by 6 with at most 10 possible uncertain blockages.
Your program should initialize
belief space value functions and use a form of value iteration
(discussed in class) to compute the value function for
the belief states. Maintain the
optimal action during the value iteration for each belief state,
so that you have the optimal policy at convergence.


<H3>Requirements </H3>

<P>
Your program should read the data, including the parameters
(start and target vertices). You should construct the policy, and
present it in some way. Provide at least the following types of output:

<OL>
<LI> A full printout of the value of each belief-state, and the
     optimal action in that belief state, if it exists. 
     (Print something that indicates so if this state is irregular,
     e.g. if it is unreachable).
<LI> Run a sequence of simulations. That is, generate a graph instance
     (blockage locations) according to the  distributions, and run the
     agent through this graph based on the (optimal) policy computed 
     by your algorithm. Display the graph instance and sequence of actions.
     Allow the user to run additional simulations, for a newly generated
     instance in each case.
</OL>



<H3>Deliverables </H3>

<OL>
<LI> Source code and executable files of programs.
<LI> Explanation of the method employed in your algorithm.
<LI> Non-trivial example runs on at least 2 scenarios,
including the input and output.
<LI> Submit makefile and short description on how to run your program.
</OL>
